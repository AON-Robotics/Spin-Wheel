# 🎡 Activity Spin Wheel

An interactive **spin wheel web app** built with **Flask**, **JavaScript**, and **Google Sheets integration**.  
Designed for fair and fun random selections based on participant “tickets” (weighted chances).  
Used by AON Robotics for activity selection and random draws.

### 🐍 Python 3.x
-Install dependencies:
    -pip install flask flask-cors gspread pandas

## 🧠 Google Cloud Setup

- 1. Go to Google Cloud Console

- 2. Enable the Google Sheets API.

- 3. Create a Service Account and download the JSON credentials file.

- 4. Rename it (or update the path in app.py):

    GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS_FILE = 'spin-wheel-aon-robotis-07ae3d09ce09.json'

## 📊 Google Sheet Format

The app expects a sheet like this:

Name	Tickets
Alice	3
Bob	5
Carol	2

**Name** → Participant’s name

**Tickets** → Number of entries (weighted chance)

Sheet and worksheet names are configured in app.py:

SPREADSHEET_NAME = 'Test'
WORKSHEET_NAME = 'Participants'

## 🖥️ Running the App

Start the Flask server:

python3 app.py

Then open your browser and visit:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/

## 🧠 How It Works

The frontend requests participant data via:

**GET /api/fetch**

→ Flask pulls the latest data from Google Sheets
→ Each participant’s wheel segment is calculated by ticket proportion

Clicking SPIN animates the wheel and randomly selects a winner
→ The winner’s name is added to the WINNERS list
→ That participant is removed from the wheel

Clicking FETCH refetches updated names from Google Sheets
→ Useful if new participants were added during runtime

Clicking CLEAR empties the winners list (resets display only)
